This directory is a placeholder for a data folder. An example data folder is made available here: **LOCATION OF ZENODO SUBMISSION**

What at the very least needs to be here is specified in ../src/config.yaml, which by default is:

- BOLD_Public.30-Dec-2022.tar.gz
- mnt/bold_public/datapackages/recent-data/BOLD_Public.30-Dec-2022.tsv
